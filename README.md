### Notes on Commiting

- I have setup the project to test itself before committing. This is setup as follows:
    - Commits will fail if test don't pass. Remove this if you would like to deploy your code without running your tests
    - This does not generate tests for you. I have simply written a few sample tests for the purposes of demonstration
```bash
"husky":{
        "hooks":{
            "pre-commit": "npm test"
        }
    }
```
